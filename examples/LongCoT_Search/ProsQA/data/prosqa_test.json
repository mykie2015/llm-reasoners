      "question": "What is the nuanced function and synergy of the forearm and wrist (手腕) in executing a perfect tennis forehand?",
      "answer": "In a perfect forehand, the wrist (手腕) subtly maintains racquet lag initiated by the unit turn and coil, acting as a hinge that releases stored energy efficiently near contact (snap). It doesn't actively 'flick' early but transfers kinetic chain energy. The forearm works in synergy, contributing to the racquet drop during coil, driving rotationally through the swing phase, and crucially executing timed pronation post-contact for heavy topspin and control, ensuring the racquet face angle is managed throughout extension.",
      "steps": [
        "The wrist (手腕) remains relaxed yet firm during the preparation phase (coil) to allow natural racquet lag, set up by the larger body rotation.",
        "The forearm contributes to the racquet drop loop during the coil.",
        "During the forward swing (uncoil), the wrist (手腕) passively maintains the lag angle, preventing casting.",
        "The forearm actively rotates and drives forward as part of the kinetic chain, transferring energy from the legs and torso.",
        "Just before and at the contact point, the wrist (手腕) firms up for stability and efficiently channels the energy, allowing a controlled 'snap' from the built-up lag.",
        "Immediately following contact, the forearm executes precise pronation (inward rotation), brushing up the ball for topspin.",
        "The degree and timing of forearm pronation are nuanced, influencing the amount of spin and trajectory.",
        "The wrist (手腕) provides a stable platform during this pronation and the subsequent follow-through extension.",
        "This synergy ensures power is generated from the kinetic chain, controlled at contact, and translated into effective topspin."
